Documentation is a drag.  It adds significant friction to development,
since it must be edited to reflect changes in the code.  As tedious as
code is to test, documentation is many times worse to validate.  A
human with a deep understanding of the project must read everything
and evaluate whether it holds true.

Pod::Plexus reduces documentation's drag.  It adds documentation by
reference, reducing the amount of work and duplication needed to
document code thoroughly.

For example, Pod::Plexus adds inheritance to POD.  Subclasses that
borrow code from their bases can also borrow the corresponding
documentation.

Pod::Plexus provides a boilerplate feature.  Common paragraphs may be
defined once and reused multiple times.  Editing a boilerplate fixes
every place it's used.

Pod::Plexus allows documentation to use real code for examples.  Fixes
applied to implementation automatically update the illustrations.

POD sections are treated as templates.  Aspects of the section and its
context can be plugged into the documentation by reference.  For
example, a section's prose can reference the section heading name
symbolically.  The section stays up to date when its heading is
renamed.

Tables of contents can be generated in a single line.  Base classes
can automatically include links to all the subclasses that accompany
it in the distribution.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodPlexus> integrates Pod::Plexus with
Dist::Zilla.

L<Pod::Weaver::Plugin::PodPlexus> is an ongoing attempt to integrate
Pod::Plexus with Pod::Weaver, if it's possible.  Help wanted!

The L<podplexus> command line utility is used to speed up development
and testing.  Help wanted to make it a useful stand-alone tool for
people who would rather not use Dist::Zilla.

Pod::Plexus leans heavily on L<PPI> and L<Moose> for code analysis.
It uses L<Pod::Elemental> to wrangle documentation.  Patches to reduce
the number and/or complexity of dependencies are very welcome.

In its default state, Pod::Plexus requires L<Pod::Weaver> or something
like it to gather and render =method and =attribute sections.  POD can
be rendered instead by subclassing L<Pod::Plexus::Matter::attribute>
and L<Pod::Plexus::Matter::method>.
